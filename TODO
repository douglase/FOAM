Main Todo Items
===============

We are looking for volunteers to do the following tasks :).

Minor fixes & tweaks

* calmodes are not system-wide, should be setup-specific. Where to include 
  this? Needs to encompass both wfs, wfc and other calibration modes. Related:
	how do we make sure a WFS knows about certain calibration modes? Cannot be 
	declared in wfs.h, has to be in implementation.

* Abstract modes, internal mode (enum) and description (string) should be 
	connected better.

* Review WFC/WFS abstraction, currently implemented inconsistently which 
  makes some things more difficult than they are.

Major feature upgrades

* Correlation tracking functions for Shack Hartmann sensors

* Adding MCAO capabilities

* Real time linux implementation of FOAM
