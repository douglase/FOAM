Main Todo Items
===============

We are looking for volunteers to do the following tasks :).

Minor fixes & tweaks

* Abstract modes, internal mode (enum) and description (string) should be 
	connected better.

* Review WFC/WFS abstraction, currently implemented inconsistently which 
  makes some things more difficult than they are.

* Implement savestate such that a complete setup can be resumed.

Major feature upgrades

* Correlation tracking functions for Shack Hartmann sensors

* Adding MCAO capabilities

* Real time linux implementation of FOAM
