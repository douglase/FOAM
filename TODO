Main Todo Items
===============

We are looking for volunteers to do the following tasks :).

Minor fixes & tweaks

* modsubapsel() / shCogTrack() -> same functions, make more general or wrap 
  around

* dispsdl -> needs autocontrast to run only once and set bright/contrast, not 
  each time (see dispgl)

* rename functions in modules to include the modulename, i.e. instead of 
  modSubapSel -> shSubapSel

* Improve configuration file inclusion by pointing to a directory defined in 
  config.h that points to the installdir of datafiles? (how?)
  Solved July 23, 2008, using configure.ac in conjuction with automake

* 2008-07-15 
  System header files included are not organised very neatly. These need to
  be moved to the specific modules actually using them, instead of dumping
  them in the library header file.

* 2008-07-16
  Dark- and flat-fielding routines should have their own separate module,
  this needs to be written 
  Improve dark/flat algorithm, raw-dark/(flat-dark) must be multiplied by
  some factor when working with 8 bit bytes (as we are), but which factor?

* 2008-07-23
  Integrate open and closed loop, and decide what to do based on the stat
  of the ptc variable. This works better with calibration as well.

Major feature upgrades

* Correlation tracking functions for Shack Hartmann sensors.

* 2008-07-15
  Fix libevent thread-unsafety such that both threads can communicate with 
  the clients

* Adding MCAO capabilities

* General streamlining and optimizations

* Real time linux implementation of FOAM (long term project)

* Porting to C++ (long term project)
