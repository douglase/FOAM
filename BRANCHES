FOAM git branches documentation.

*** Semi-permanent development branches

* master
Main development branch. Should compile.

* production
Production branch. Must compile & work stably.

* gh-pages
GitHub website branch. Not actively used.

*** Temporary branches

These branches come and go, and this list might not be up-to-date. Check git log and gitk for details.

* topic_andor_speed (implemented)
Improve Andor speed: EM CCD gain and frame transfer

* topic_tt_offload (implemented)
Offload tip-tilt to WHT. Implement coordinate conversion and RS232 writing

* topic_compile_gitrev (implemented)
Read version and include in binary

* topic_wfc_mutex (implemented)
When operating in closed loop, and when setting the actuators manually as well, somethings some function could be called simultaneously. We use a mutex to solve this problem and let only one thread at a time call actuate().

* topic_calib_store (RC)
Store calibration files for re-use lateron

* topic_compile_gitrev2
Need to execute ./version.sh at compile time, *not* only at commit time!

* topic_gui_wht (implemented in master)
Add telescope GUI. Shows telescope position, raw shift, converted shift.
Todo: show control packets to telescope, add control for ccd_ang, scalefac, gain, altfac?

* topic_simstat_update
Update simstatic mode after a long time

* topic_doc_fix (RC)
Fix/extend doxygen documentation

* topic_infl_bootstrap (implemented in master)
Improve influence matrix calibration if we have a flat reset() mirror shape
-> Do not reste mirror to 0 in between actuators OK
-> Give amplitude for influence matrix calibration as parameter OK
-> Test 0 control versus 0 volts OK

* topic_testing_dummy (implemented in master, RC)
Use FOAM_dummy in hardware tests so we have small stand-alone programs for each piece of hardware.

* topic_usability_fix (implemented in master)
Fix some network commands
v frame transfer -> works
v temperature -> works
v darkfield? -> works, no stats yet?

* topic_cam_statsfix (implemented in master)
Ignore bright and dark pixels, ignore andor rightmost column of pixels
v ignore outer edge pixels in statistics calculations -> works

* topic_cog_threshold (implemented in master)
- Implement CoG threshold (shift_mini) live update -> works
- Implement SHWFS tracking clamping -> works

* topic_wfc_clamp (implemented in master)
- Clamp WFC control signals to prevent badness -> works

* topic_ui_stats (implemented)
- Calculate image stats in GUI only (rms, avg, etc.) -> works

* topic_dev_ignorelist (RC)
- Add list of commands not to report in the terminal for each Device

* topic_ui_wfs (implemented, testing)
- Implement reset subaps, toggle show subaps

* topic_ui_wfcgain (implemented, testing)
- Implement gain setting for WFC

* topic_ui_histo
- Reduce histogram to 256 bins

* topic_live_mode (RC)
- Implement live mode updates
-> during calibration, store 3 SVD matrices
-> during runtime, multiply 3 matrices sequentially, with a varying number of singular values

* topic_scale_shift
- Normalize shifts measured in GUI to size of sub apertures

* miscellaneous
