$This file contains an orientation for the architecture of the new AO system
$based on the ctrla3.c file 

Problems with current system:
 -very non-portable
 --code only works on specific linux 2.4 kernels on machines with SSE(2?)
 --drivers for mirror and other controllers more or less integrated
   which forces the use of those devices
 -code is a mess
 --different software was combined to form the current system
   which probably has some redundant or unnecessary code

New system's requirements:
 -portability!
 --should be portable across a large range of platforms, at least across
   different kernels or distro's (mainly linux/unix though)
 -modularity!
 --should not be as intergrated or monolithic as the old system, but be composed
   of seperate modules interacting in a simple fashion. This should also provide
   portability.
 -speed
 --of lesser concern, but the system should run at 1000 fps on most machines
   (currently ASM is used to guarantee this, but this is on a P3).
 -easy of use
 --system should be easy enough to be operated by someone who did not design it
   or knows anything about it. A simple few-page manual should suffice.

Elements to include in the system (and properties/methods)
 -deformable mirror
 --controller(s?)
 ---gain
 --nr of modes to correct
 --gain
 =-jolt mirror
 --measure displacement
 --flatten mirror
 --linearity test
 -telescope
 --angle
 --gain (?)
 -filter wheel
 --position (e.g. filter used)
 -tip tilt mirror
 --gain
 --sign
 -camera
 -wavefront sensor
 --mainly SH, but others as well?
 --pinhole calibration
 --axes of wavefront sensing(?)
 -ao host computer
 --dm controlling
 --sh sensing & analysis
 --reconstruction operation (controller matrix?)
 ---calibrate, nr of modes to use
 --calibration (dark, flat, control matrix)
 --display data (rate reduction)
 --open/close loop

Element properties:
 DM:
 -gain
 -nr of modes to use
 -response (e.g. linear, squared etc)
 -influence function?
 
Problems
  some modes' function not clear in ctrla3.c
  -scanning?
