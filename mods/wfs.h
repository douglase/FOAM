 @brief Base wavefront-sensor class. 
 
 This class provides a template for the implementation of wavefront sensors 
 such as a Shack-Hartmann WFS. This class should be implemented with WFS
 specific routines. The Wfs class is independent of the camera used and
 only provides the data processing/interpretation of the camera. The camera
 itself can be accessed through the reference &cam.
