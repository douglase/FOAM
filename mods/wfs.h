 @brief Base wavefront-sensor class. 
 
 This class provides a template for the implementation of wavefront sensors 
 such as a Shack-Hartmann WFS. This class should be implemented with WFS
 specific routines. The Wfs class is independent of the camera used and
 only provides the data processing/interpretation of the camera. The camera
 itself can be accessed through the reference &cam.
 
 \section wfs_netio Network IO
 
 - measuretest: force fake measurements being produced (to test GUI etc.)
 - calibrate: calibrate device (mostly allocate memory etc.)
 - measure: force manual measurement (should normally be done by FOAM itself)

 - get basis: return the basis functions used for measurement (i.e. shifts, zernike, KL)
 - get modes: return N modes as <N> <M#1> <M#2> ... <M#N>. 'Modes' can be 
 - get calib: get calibration state
 - get camera: return camera name associated with this WFS
 
 \section wfs_cfg Configuration
 
 - none
