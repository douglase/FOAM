Install for the impatient

 - Generate configure script:
   $ autoreconf -s -i
 - Configure FOAM:
   $ ./configure
 - Optionally: install missing libraries
 - Build the program:
   $ make
 - Run FOAM:
   $ cd src/
   $ ./foamcs-<sim|dummy|statsim>
   FOAM will initialize and then stop doing anything.
 - Connect to FOAM at default address:
   $ telnet localhost 10000

Installation

TODO, see above section in the meantime.

Dependencies

For compiling, FOAM needs (at least):

 - automake/autoconf tools
 - pkg-config (if not already supplied)

At runtime, FOAM depends on the following libraries:

 - libfftw3
 - libsdl and libsdl_image
 - libevent
 - libgsl
 - a BLAS, like ATLAS (via libgslcblas)

Known issues

 - On OS X, pkg-config might not be setup correctly when using fink. Because
   Apple provides its own set of aclocal files, these conflict with the ones
   supplied by fink. To fix, symlink /usr/share/aclocal to /sw/share/aclocal
   and set up the variables
    ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /usr/share/aclocal "
   and
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/sw/lib/pkgconfig "
   in your login script (i.e. ~/.profile)

 - On OS X, SDL appears to give some sort of memory leak, which crashes the
   program just before stopping it over the network ('shutdown'). The
   cause of this is as of yet unknown.
