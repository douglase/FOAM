FOAM - Modular Adative Optics Framework
=======================================

This is FOAM, the Modular Adaptive Optics Framework, a collection of 
routines to drive adaptive optics systems in various scenarios.
It was programmed as part of a master research at Utrecht University,
2007--2008 by Tim van Werkhoven (t.i.m.vanwerkhoven@xs4all.nl).

Availability
============

The current stable version of FOAM is always available from 
http://www.phys.uu.nl/~werkhvn/research/FOAM.html or
http://tvwerkhoven.github.com/FOAM/

Installation
============

Before installing FOAM, please install libsiu first. This utility library
is available at <http://dotdb.phys.uu.nl/git/browse>. To install this
software:

- git clone http://dotdb.phys.uu.nl/git/libsiu libsiu
- cd libsiu
- autoreconf -sfi
- ./configure
- make -j2

After that, point to the libsiu/src directory when installing FOAM.

FOAM tries to follow the standard GNU installation procedure. Please 
consult the INSTALL file in this distribution for more detailed 
instructions.

For information about specific platforms and compilers see the
INSTALL.default file.

Testing
=======

You can test FOAM with the different simulations modes. One begin the full 
simulation, the other static.

To test, run:

./foam/foam-fullsim -c conf/foam-fullsim.cfg

or

./foam/foam-simstat -c conf/foam-simstat2.cfg
