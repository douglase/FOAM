FOAM - Modular Adative Optics Framework
=======================================

This is FOAM, the Modular Adaptive Optics Framework, a collection of 
routines to drive adaptive optics systems in various scenarios.
It was programmed as part of a master research at Utrecht University,
2007--2008 by Tim van Werkhoven <werkhoven@strw.leidenuniv.nl>

Availability
============

The current stable version of FOAM is always available from 
<https://github.com/tvwerkhoven/FOAM> or 
<https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~werkh108/FOAM/>.

Testing
=======

You can test FOAM with the different simulations modes. One begin the full 
simulation, the other static.

To test, run:

./foam/foam-fullsim -c conf/foam-fullsim.cfg

or

./foam/foam-simstat -c conf/foam-simstat.cfg
