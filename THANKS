During the development of FOAM, the following people provided helpful insights
on various occassions:

* Guus Sliepen for his expertise on discussion and suggestions. It would've been a
  lot harder without his expertise on programming.

* Christoph Keller for supervising this project.

* Claude Plymate for suggestions to improve the functionality and
  usability of the system. Also for testing stuff at Kitt Peak.
  
* Eric Galayda for helping to test the software at Kitt Peak.
