This directory is used for testing modules in stand-alone mode. Some modules
can be compiled as stand alone versions which then include a main() routine
and thus can be run directly. This can be useful for debugging modules
before using them in a bigger program.

See Makefile.am for details on how this works, and also take a look at the 
modules listed there (i.e. img, itifg, daq2k, serial, okodm).

Note that the itifg module cannot (easily) be compiled using automake
statements, as it needs -litifg AFTER all source files, and LDFLAGS are
given BEFORE source files if using automake.
