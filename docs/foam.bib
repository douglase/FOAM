    abstract = {{The Extreme Polarimeter (ExPo) is approaching its first deployment at
the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope at La Palma. This imaging
polarimeter, developed at the Astronomical Institute of Utrecht
University, aims to study circumstellar material at a contrast ratio
with the central star of 10<SUP>-9</SUP>. Working at visible
wavelengths, it will provide an inner working angle down to 0.5 arcsec
and a field of view of 20 arcsec diameter. ExPo employs a dual
beam-exchange technique based on polarimeter designs for solar studies.
A partially transmitting coronagraph mask placed in the first focus
reduces the light of the star. The beam is modulated using three
ferro-electric liquid crystals in a Pancharatnam configuration, then
split in a polarizing beamsplitter. Both beams are re-imaged onto the
same Electron-Multiplying CCD camera. We present the design of the ExPo
instrument, highlighting the elements that are critical to the
polarimetric performance. Some prototype laboratory experiments
demonstrating the instrument concept are discussed. These have been
performed using our realistic exoplanet laboratory simulator.}},

@mastersthesis{homs2012,
    abstract = {One of the main goals of modern day astronomy is the direct observation and char- acterization of planets orbiting other stars than our Sun. This is extremely difficult because of the high contrast between the brightness of the planets and the star, up to 10−9. By developing polarimetric imagers like the Extreme Polarimeter, or {ExPo}, we hope to reach this contrast and for the first time observe the light from these exoplanets directly.
With polarimetry alone {ExPo} has already reached on-sky contrast of 10−4 and in the lab with the use of a coronagraph even up to 10−8. But to use the coronagraph the star has to be exactly centered on the coronagraph spot, but due to the movement of the star by atmospheric disturbances of the light this has been impossible outside of a controlled testing environment.
An adaptive optics system with a {Shack–Hartmann} wavefront sensor and a 97 actuator deformable mirror has been developed for the Extreme Polarimeter to correct for these disturbances. Designed specifically with polarimetry in mind and a large stroke for tip-tilt correction, Super {ExPo} is the next step towards higher contrast imaging with {ExPo}. The commissioning run is scheduled for the end of June this year.},

@mastersthesis{werkhoven2008,
    abstract = {{Astronomical observations done from the ground are hampered in many ways by the Earth's atmosphere. Several techniques exist to remedy these problems, one of which is adaptive optics. The control mechanism behind adaptive optics has long been specialised hardware with little flexibility. This makes these systems highly non-portable and difficult to modify. Generic computers are now getting to a point where their performance is good enough to take over from these specialised pieces of hardware.
	
FOAM, backwards for Modular Adaptive Optics Framework, is a piece of software that aims to provide a platform which can be used on a wide variety of adaptive optics systems. To achieve this, the setup is modular such that pieces of code can be re-used easily. Furthermore, FOAM is open source and can be used by anyone, it is well-documented such that collaboration is possible. 
	
In its current state, FOAM provides a modest library of modules which allow it to analyse and process Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor output, and drive wavefront correctors with this. Additionally, it provides modules to simulate an adaptive optics system. The program has been implemented and tested on the McMath-Pierce telescope and is able to provide real-time tip-tilt correction.}},
