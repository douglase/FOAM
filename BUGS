- Random malloc error: double-free
Sometimes somewhere there is a double free() happening, crashing the system. Unsure why.

--> happened during manual actuator setting, probably collision

- calib_store does not initialize the matrix data properly? Crashes when running SVD

--> influence was not loaded properly, fixed now?

- check subimg bounds should be part of making a subap mask, should be earlier

- error on calib fail should be more explicit
