BUG #1 - 2008-04-03 10:34
exiting not clean
-------------------------

When exiting from the worker thread using exit() (i.e. upon failure or error),
this gives errors on at least OS X. This is probably due to quitting from the
wrong thread using SDL. Proposed solution: signal main thread to stop the
program, instead of exiting directly.
