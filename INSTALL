FOAM - Modular Adative Optics Framework
=======================================

FOAM follows standard installation routines. If you checked this source
out from git though, you need to take a few extra steps. For information 
about specific platforms and compilers see the INSTALL.default file.

Prerequisites
=============

FOAM depends on a number of other libraries. A custom library that is required 
is LibSIU (see below).

A list of other requirements FOAM has:

- libm, pthread (should be available on all POSIX systems)
- cfitsio
- sigc++-2.0 >= 2.0
- libgsl >= 1.11

Other libraries that are used by specific parts of FOAM:

* Full simulation

- libz (optional, for LibSIU::ImgData)
- libics (optional, for LibSIU::ImgData)
- fftw3 >= 3.1.2

* Gui

- gtkmm-2.4 >= 2.6
- gthread-2.0 >= 2.16.6
- opengl, glu, glut
- gtkglextmm-1.2 >= 1.2.0


LibSIU
======

Before installing FOAM, please install libsiu first. This utility library
is available at <http://dotdb.phys.uu.nl/git/browse>. To install this
software:

- git clone http://dotdb.phys.uu.nl/git/libsiu libsiu
- cd libsiu
- autoreconf -sfi
- ./configure
- make -j2

After that, point to the libsiu/src directory when installing FOAM, i.e.

- cd $FOAMDIR
- ln -s $LIBSIUDIR libsiu

FOAM
====

To install FOAM when checking out from the git repository, please first run:

- ./version.sh
- autoreconf -sfi

followed by the regular installation procedure:

- ./configure --help
- ./configure
- make
- make install

To make the test programs as well, run

- make check

For information about specific platforms and compilers see the
INSTALL.default file.

For more information on running or testing the software, see the README file.

Documentation
=============

The FOAM sourcecode is highlighted with Doxygen-compatible comments. To 
extract this information and present it in a easily navigatable format, run:

- make all

in the source root. The documentation will then be available in HTML and 
LaTeX formats in docs/.

N.B. To generate documentation you need doxygen and graphviz to generate 
call-graphs!

If you need more extensive documentation, run

- ./configure --enable-extdocs

before make all to enable more verbose documentation. The difference is in 
whether the more verbose docs/doxyfile-debug or the somewhat less 
frightening docs/doxyfile is used while generating docs. You can also manually
make the documentation by running

- cd docs
- doxygen [doxyfile-debug|doxyfile]
