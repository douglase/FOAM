FOAM - Modular Adative Optics Framework
=======================================

FOAM follows standard installation routines. If you checked this source
out from git though, you need to take a few extra steps.

LibSIU
======

Before installing FOAM, please install libsiu first. This utility library
is available at <http://dotdb.phys.uu.nl/git/browse>. To install this
software:

- git clone http://dotdb.phys.uu.nl/git/libsiu libsiu
- cd libsiu
- autoreconf -sfi
- ./configure
- make -j2

After that, point to the libsiu/src directory when installing FOAM, i.e.

- cd $FOAMDIR
- ln -s $LIBSIUDIR libsiu

FOAM
====

To install FOAM when checking out from the git repository, please first run:

- ./version.sh
- autoreconf -sfi

followed by the regular installation procedure:

- ./configure --help
- ./confgiure
- make

For information about specific platforms and compilers see the
INSTALL file.

Testing
=======

You can test FOAM with the different simulations modes. One begin the full 
simulation, the other static.

To test, run: 

- ./foam/foam-fullsim -c conf/foam-fullsim.cfg

or

- ./foam/foam-simstat -c conf/foam-simstat2.cfg
